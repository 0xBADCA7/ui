# ui: platform-native GUI library for Go

This is a library that aims to provide simple GUI software development in Go.

It is based on my [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui), a simple cross-platform library that does the same thing, but written in C. **You must include this library in your binary distributions.**

It runs on/requires:

- Windows: cgo, Windows Vista and newer
- Mac OS X: cgo, Mac OS X 10.7 and newer
- other Unixes: cgo, GTK+ 3.4 and newer

TODO figure out the minimum required version of Go

(this README needs some work)

# Installation

# Documentation

The in-code documentation needs improvement. I have written a [tutorial](https://github.com/andlabs/ui/wiki/Getting-Started) in the Wiki.
