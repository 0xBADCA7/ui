Woah, lots of attention! Thanks!

This is a placeholder README; the previous file (olddocs/oldREADME.md) was rather long and confusing. I'll be rewriting it properly soon.

Until then, here's the important things you need to know:
- **this package is very much incomplete; see `stable.md` for a list of what is guaranteed to not change at the API level â€” for everything newer, you have been warned!**
- this package requires Go 1.3, which is presently available as a RC build (source builds from go tip will work too)
	- I don't think the Windows side uses any Go 1.3 features, but just to be safe I'm going to say express caution
	- Unix builds need 1.3 to fix some type-checker bugs in cgo
	- Mac OS X builds need 1.3 because Go 1.3 adds Objective-C support to cgo
- the Windows build does not need cgo unless you want to regenerate the `zconstants_windows_*.go` files; the other targets **do**
- my plan is to target all versions of OSs that Go itself supports; that means:
	- Windows: Windows XP or newer
	- Unix: this is trickier; I decided to settle on GTK+ 3.4 or newer as Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ships with it
	- Mac OS X: Mac OS X 10.6 or newer
- for the Windows build, you won't need to provide a comctl32.dll version 6 manifest, as the package produces its own
	- comctl32.dll version 6 *is* required for proper functioning!

[andlabs/wakeup](https://github.com/andlabs/wakeup) is a repository that provides a sample application.

If you are feeling adventurous, running `./test.sh` (which accepts `go build` options) from within the package directory will build a test program which I use to make sure everything works. (I'm not sure how to do automated tests for a package like this, so `go test` will say no tests found for now; sorry.) If you are cross-compiling to Windows, you will need to have a very specific Go setup which allows multiple cross-compilation setups in a single installation; this requires [a CL which won't be in Go 1.3 but may appear in Go 1.4 if accepted](https://codereview.appspot.com/93580043) and both windows/386 and windows/amd64 set up for cgo. (This is because `./test.sh` on Windows targets invariably regenerates the `zconstants_windows_*.go` files; there is no option to turn it off lest I become complacent and use it myself.)

Finally, please send documentation suggestions! I'm taking the documentation of this package very seriously because I don't want to make **anything** ambiguous. (Trust me, ambiguity in API documentation was a pain when writing this...)

Thanks!

(Note: I temporarily disabled Travis.ci; if I can figure out how to do good cross-compiles with it, then I can put it back.)
