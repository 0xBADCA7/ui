In the interest of making sure that everything in ui is consistent, here is a glossary of various conflicting terms and what they mean to the library. These are disjunct from the terminology used by each backend's native platform; context should be used to differentiate where appropriate.

CONTAINER
	a uiControl that hosts other controls, such as uiStack and uiGrid
PARENT
	a non-uiControl that maintains a single uiControl; that uiControl can be a container, in which case the purpose of the parent is to collect the controls in that container for the purpose of the operating system as a holder
HOLDER
	a non-uiControl that hosts an uiControl from the perspective of the operating system
	this should always be a parent
CONTENT
	the non-uiControl that acts as a parent and a holder; this is used by uiWindow and uiTab
