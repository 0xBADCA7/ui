- all SendMessage() calls
- BM_GETCHECK (sysData.isChecked())
- WM_GETTEXTLENGTH (LRESULT is unsinged so) (sysData.text())
- WM_GETTEXT (WM_GETTEXTLENGTH docs say its result may be larger than the actual length, so we can't use that) (sysData.text())
- CB_GETCURSEL/LB_GETCURSEL (sysData.selectedIndex())
- LB_GETSELCOUNT/LB_GETSELITEMS (LB_ERR is returned if this is a single-selection listbox; are there actual errors?) (sysData.selectedIndices())
- LB_GETTEXTLEN/LB_GETTEXT (LB_ERR is returned if the given index is invalid, but since we get indices from LB_GETSELITEMS this shouldn't happen; are there actual errors?) (sysData.selectedTexts())
- PeekMessage(), TranslateMessage(), DispatchMessage() (the first one is odd as GetMessage() can return an error but PeekMessage() doesn't?) (msgloopstep())
- GetStartupInfoW() (MSDN explicitly says this function does not fail... oh really? well I suppose it cannot fail since it returns something all processes must have to begin with) (getWinMainnCmdShow())
