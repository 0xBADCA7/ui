Group
		container.go: add Group to the list of controls in the description of container
	Mac OS X: NSBox
		container_darwin.m: figure out if our setFrameSize: thing applies to resizing the groupbox as well
Control
	Enable()
	Disable()
Table
	more column types: "// As such, a Table renders a []struct{...} where each field of the struct can be a string, a number, an image, or a checkbox."
		table_darwin.m: constructor
		table_unix.c: goTableModel_get_column_type(), goTableModel_get_value()
	multiple selection
Tab
	// [TODO if each tab of your Tab is going to have the same content Controls, then use LikeTab instead, to conserve resources]
	Delete()
		// Delete removes the given tab.
		// It panics if index is out of range.
		// After Delete(), the effect of accessing the Control of the deleted tab or any of its children is undefned. [TODO reword?]
	investigate close buttons (especially for LikeTab)
Area
	Repaint(rect image.Rectangle)
Tree
	Mac OS X: make sure newScrollView() has the correct parameters for Table and Tree (and that Area has the appropriate ones from both + its own no border)
TextArea
	Mac OS X: be sure to call disableAutocorrect()

so I don't forget, some TODOs:
windows
	- backgrounds are not transparent
mac os x
	- applicationShouldTerminate: not handled
